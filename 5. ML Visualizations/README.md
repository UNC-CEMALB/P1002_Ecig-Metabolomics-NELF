# Confusion Matrix Figure
- Visualization of confusion matrix metrics from all supervised machine learning models tested (KNN, SVM, and RF)

# Decision Boundary Plot
- Visualization of two of the most significant predictors in lung response models (ie. Chol and Vitamin D) to determine how well those variables could predict lung response status

# Variable Importance Plot
- Shows the top predictors in random forest models and which fall about background noise
